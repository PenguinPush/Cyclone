# CYCLONE üå™Ô∏è

**CYCLONE** is an AI-powered platform designed to help users navigate their menstrual cycle with confidence and ease. It goes beyond just tracking periods‚ÄîCYCLONE addresses the broader issues of menstrual health, period poverty, and education, offering a comprehensive solution for users.

## üöÄ FEATURES

### PERSONALIZED PERIOD TRACKER
CYCLONE uses Wolfram Alpha‚Äôs instant calculator API to provide users with valuable statistics about their menstrual cycle, such as the number of days until the next period and the current phase of the cycle. This information is presented on a comprehensible dashboard and calendar.

### MENSTRUAL MAP
The MENSTRUAL MAP tracks and pins public locations offering free menstrual products for those who can‚Äôt afford them. This feature is especially useful for addressing period poverty and ensuring access to essential resources.

### PEPPA - THE AI CHATBOT
Meet PEPPA, your AI-powered personal assistant for period management. Hosted using Wolfram‚Äôs cloud computing software, PEPPA offers reminders, advice, and answers to any questions users may have about their menstrual cycle.

### PRODUCT FINDER
CYCLONE‚Äôs PRODUCT FINDER harnesses machine learning to recommend menstrual products tailored to each user‚Äôs preferences, lifestyle, and budget. It scans major online retailers like Amazon and Walmart to deliver personalized product recommendations.

### CYCLASH - THE EDUCATIONAL PARKOUR GAME
CYCLASH is an educational parkour game that gamifies learning about the menstrual cycle. Players navigate through challenging terrains while answering questions about menstruation. Incorrect answers result in penalties, such as period cramps that slow down the player's movement.

## üí° INSPIRATION

CYCLONE was inspired by the lack of comprehensive and accessible menstrual health solutions. We aimed to create a platform that not only provides accurate period tracking but also supports those in need by addressing period poverty. Additionally, CYCLONE includes educational features to help men and women alike better understand the menstrual cycle.

## üöß CHALLENGES WE FACED

- **DESIGN TO CODE TRANSITION**: Translating Figma designs into HTML while maintaining the aesthetic integrity was challenging.
- **SPRITE ANIMATIONS**: Creating complex animations for the game required multiple images and careful coordination.
- **API INTEGRATION**: Ensuring seamless data flow and real-time updates from multiple APIs was a technical hurdle.

## üéâ ACCOMPLISHMENTS

- Created a user-friendly platform that addresses real needs.
- Developed an educational game that makes learning about periods fun.
- Made a tangible contribution to creating a period-friendly world.

## üìö WHAT WE LEARNED

- How to effectively use Wolfram Alpha‚Äôs API for menstrual cycle tracking.
- The process of developing an engaging game using Unity.
- Valuable insights from hackathon workshops on NLP and Women in STEM.

## üîÆ WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT

- **MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT**: We plan to transition CYCLONE to a mobile app for easier access and enhanced user experience.
- **PARTNERSHIPS**: We aim to expand the MENSTRUAL MAP feature by partnering with organizations that support menstrual health.
